# Copy This Workflow into GitHub

When installing through the GitHub website, create a new file named `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, then copy **only** the YAML below and paste it into GitHub.

```yml
name: Deploy static portfolio to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: pages
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
          cache: pnpm
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm test && pnpm check && pnpm build
      - uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

> This workflow is intentionally different from GitHub's generic `static.yml` starter workflow. It builds the portfolio first and publishes `dist`.
